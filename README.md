# Gideon: A GPT-based Model for Physics, Electronics, and Computer Science

## Overview

Gideon is a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model trained on a dataset encompassing Physics, Electronics, and Computer Science. This model aims to generate text and assist users in tasks related to these domains.

## Dependencies

- TensorFlow
- Transformers

## Installation

To install the dependencies, use the following commands:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
pip install transformers
```

Usage
Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Gather a diverse dataset of text related to Physics, Electronics, and Computer Science.
Preprocess the data by cleaning it, removing noise, and tokenizing the text.
Model Training:
Train the Gideon model using the preprocessed dataset.
Define model architecture, training parameters, and optimizer.
Evaluation:
Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics.
Qualitative assessment by inspecting generated text samples.
Fine-tuning:
Fine-tune the model on specific tasks or datasets within each domain for improved performance.
Deployment:
Deploy the trained model in applications related to Physics, Electronics, and Computer Science.
Example Code
Below is an example of how to use Gideon to generate text:

python
Copy code
import tensorflow as tf
from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, TFGPT2LMHeadModel

# Load pre-trained GPT2 tokenizer and model
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gideon_tokenizer")
model = TFGPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("gideon_model", pad_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id)

# Example usage: Generate text
```bash
prompt = "The laws of physics"
input_ids = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="tf")["input_ids"]
output_ids = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=100, num_return_sequences=1)
generated_text = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

print("Generated text:", generated_text)
```
